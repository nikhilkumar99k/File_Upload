# File Upload and Short Link Generator

## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to upload files and generate short links for easy sharing. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, and Body Parser. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for file uploads and link generation, inspired by the Farm Art official website.

## Features

- **File Upload:** Users can upload files (limited to PDF and DOCX formats, with a maximum size of 1MB).
- **Short Link Generation:** After uploading a file, the application generates a short link for easy sharing.
- **Password Protection:** Users can set a password for file downloads, enhancing security.
- **Download Functionality:** Users with the correct password can download the uploaded file directly from the application.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure for a Node.js and Express application:

- `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering HTML pages.
- `public/`: Stores static assets like stylesheets (CSS), client-side JavaScript files, and images.
- `uploads/`: The folder where uploaded files are stored on the server.
- `server.js`: The main Node.js file containing the Express server setup and route handling.
