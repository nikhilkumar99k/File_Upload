## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to upload files and generate short links for easy sharing. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, and Body Parser. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for file uploads and link generation, inspired by the Farm Art official website.

## Features

- **Password Protection:** Users can set a password for file downloads, enhancing security.
- **Download Functionality:** Users with the correct password can download the uploaded file directly from the application.
